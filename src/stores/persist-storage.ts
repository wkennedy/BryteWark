// JSON storage for zustand `persist`, backed by AsyncStorage.
//
// A read that fails resolves as "nothing stored" instead of rejecting.
// Android's AsyncStorage can't return a row larger than its ~2 MB
// CursorWindow, and a truncated or corrupt row fails JSON.parse. zustand only
// marks a store hydrated when the read succeeds, so a rejected read left
// `persist.hasHydrated()` false for good and session restore waiting on it.
// Now the store starts empty and its next write replaces the bad row.
//
// `persist` calls setItem with the whole partialized slice on every set(),
// including one that only flips `loading`. Writes are coalesced instead: a
// slice whose fields are the same references as the last one is dropped, the
// rest wait up to PERSIST_WRITE_DELAY_MS and only the newest is serialised,
// and JSON identical to what is stored isn't written again. Pending writes
// go out as soon as the app leaves the foreground.
